# illustrative of my development protocol

I work, chiefly, on an iterate-and-gaze model of development. Using the development of this project, realistically pegged to time, as an illustration, i can walk through the forensics.


### prologue

I was migrating a personal server from 1&1 to Amazon's EC2.

The deployment at 1&1 had consisted of a server instance which had no firewall between the public internet and itself, so i handled port and IP blocking via iptables and some scripting.

EC2, on the other hand, uses a 'security group' which is basically a set of firewall rules. I wanted to keep port 22 shutdown except when needed to be open for usage (SFTP, SSH, ...) so i decided to write this knock-knock server.

Prior to starting the project, i was aware that Amazon offered command line functionality to affect the EC2 configuration and assets (but not what that functionality was, per se,) and aware that there was an SDK for at least C++ (due to my S3 related work on TensorFlow,) and so assumed there must be a Java SDK as well. I was also aware of, but unexperienced with, [Spark.](http://sparkjava.com/)

### act one

My first iterations are near-ubiquitously a quickly produced, pixelated, satisfaction of minimal needs without devotion to niceties (where niceties include configurability, robust failure handling, spacetime optimizations, etc.)

This 'burstiness' always appears apropos in creation, whether due to someone presenting me with an emergency, or being in a fixed time interview, or initial cogitation having created a crystalline compact form ready for production, or &hellip;

As a basic knock-knock server is a pretty simple idea, the largest facet to the first iteration was performing the Seth-Brundle-in-*The Fly* task of largely piecing together chunks of functionality that other people had written. I needed a simple way to receive and act upon HTTP requests (Spark) and i needed a way to affect my EC2 configuration (Amazon's SDK;) so, I Googled for POM assets and API docs and set out to do it.

Circa seven work hours later, the project was created and [the initial iteration](https://github.com/quaeler/ec2-knock-knock/releases/tag/v0.8) was QC'd & deployed to my EC2 instance.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>

### intermission

With the first iteration out the door and the EC2 instance now being minimally usable, i was then able to enter the "gaze" phase of development. Over the next couple days, i periodically considered what would make it a nicer application in terms of flexibility and functionality. I concluded that it would be good to:
* introduce more professional handling of command line parameters
* allow more configurability, for example defining the ingress port to open
* count on the fact that user's can't be trusted to clean up after themselves and, so, introduce session tracking within the application to revoke ingress permissions after a time-out period had passed
* refine the logging to be less noisy

On the day following that, i gathered a mental image of how i would affect the code to implement these things.

### act two

I'm not designing for a heavy transaction load, and am much more concerned with a single jar with no external dependencies while still supporting a backing store to allow for session tracking persistence, so i chose H2 as the backing store and Hibernate as the ORM. For the command line parsing, i chose to use commons as it has always been reliable for me in the past.

With these things in mind, and the mental picture fixed, i set out to commit it to code. Circa twelve work hours later, [the second iteration](https://github.com/quaeler/ec2-knock-knock/releases/tag/v0.9)<sup>[2](#footnotes)</sup> was QC'd and deployed to my EC2 instance.

<small>1. As a fine technical point, there's no reason the knock-knock server need actually run on the EC2 instance itself as it is modifying data located at a separate location â€” unlike a knock-knock server which directly fiddles with iptables on the instance.</small>
